This is an ecommerse website build for selling of any products online. In this project we have mainly considered to adding the products to the users cart and again let them decide the amount of item to buy. The users can increase or decrease the items amount in the cart. After that the user may pay and get the orderÂ successful.

Basically Website is built on Python / Django.

Note :- Some Functionalities are still not working.
